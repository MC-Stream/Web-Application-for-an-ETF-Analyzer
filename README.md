# Web Application for an ETF Analyzer

This is a Jupyter notebook that will build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voil√† library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF. Though the ETF is hypothetical, a real one can just as easily be substituted in to the database allowing the analysis to be run on that one instead. This framework will allow the company to analyze ETFs for potential distribution to the clientele. This notebook will be viewable via Voila webpage, as listed below.
